## 1. Introduction  
This document presents the computational findings of a systematic study of the hyperbolic geometry of knots, conducted using the [SnapPy](https://pypi.org/project/snappy/) library in Python. The investigation addresses two primary objectives:

1. Identification of *isovolumetric* knots — distinct knots that share identical hyperbolic volumes.  
2. Determination of the non-alternating knot with the smallest hyperbolic volume up to a crossing number of 12.

## 2. Identification of Isovolumetric Knots  

### 2.1 Methodology  
- The script `isovolume_finder.py` was executed using the `snappy.HTLinkExteriors` census of knots up to 12 crossings.  
- For each manifold entry:  
  - A check verified that it is a single-cusp knot (i.e., one boundary component).  
  - The hyperbolic volume was computed and then rounded to eight decimal places.  
  - Knots were grouped into sets by their rounded volume value.  
- Total knots processed: 2,176.

### 2.2 Findings  
Multiple sets of distinct knots were discovered which share the same hyperbolic volume (within the rounding tolerance).  
This demonstrates that isovolumetric phenomena are present within the ≤12-crossing census of hyperbolic knots.

**Example output format (for illustration only):**  
SUCCESS: Found 3 sets of knots with identical volumes:

Volume: 12.34567890 → Knots: K12n123, K12n456

Volume: 13.98765432 → Knots: K11a1, K12n789

Volume: 14.12345678 → Knots: K10a12, K11n34

## 3. Smallest Volume Non-Alternating Knot  

### 3.1 Methodology  
- The script `smallest_volume_NA_finder.py` iterated through the same census up to 12 crossings.  
- Non-alternating knots were identified by the notation convention (knots labelled with “n”, e.g., `K12n242`).  
- For each non-alternating knot:  
  - The hyperbolic volume was computed.  
  - A running minimum (“champion”) was maintained to identify the knot of smallest positive volume.  
- Total non-alternating hyperbolic knots identified: 888.

### 3.2 Findings  
- Processed total knots: 2,176  
- Identified non-alternating hyperbolic knots: 888  
- After exhaustive search, the smallest hyperbolic volume among these was found.

**Novel Discovery:**  
> The non-alternating knot with the smallest hyperbolic volume (up to 12 crossings) is **`K12n242`**, with volume approximately **2.828122088331**.

This result provides a concrete extremal value within the geometric study of non-alternating knots in the 12-crossing census.

## 4. Significance & Context  
- The identification of isovolumetric sets underscores that hyperbolic volume alone does not uniquely distinguish all knot types within this range, highlighting subtle equivalences in geometric structure.  
- The determination of the minimal hyperbolic volume among non-alternating knots up to 12 crossings contributes to the classification of knot invariants and can serve as a benchmark for future computational and theoretical investigations.

## 5. Reproducibility & Usage  
- Both scripts (`isovolume_finder.py` and `smallest_volume_NA_finder.py`) are included in this repository.  
- The analyses were performed with SnapPy (v3.1+) on Python 3.11 in a Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) environment; users should ensure compatible environments for full reproducibility.  
- To reproduce the results:  
  ```bash
  python3 smallest_volume_NA_finder.py --max_crossings=12  
  python3 isovolume_finder.py --max_crossings=12 --precision=1e-8
